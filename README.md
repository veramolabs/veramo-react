# Getting Started with Veramo React

Veramo React makes it easy to interact with multiple agents in React Applications.

## Local development

- Clone repo
- Build project ~ `yarn build`
- Link npm/yarn ~ `yarn link`
- Link to your project's react version `yarn link ../<PROJECT_NAME>/node_modules/react`

In your react project run:

- `yarn link @veramo-community/veramo-react`
- `cd node_modules/react`
- `yarn link`

Back in `veramo-react`

- `yarn link react`
